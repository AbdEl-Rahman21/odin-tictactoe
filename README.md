# Tic Tac Toe

The first of two project for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-tic-tac-toe) OOP course. It was later used for practice for the [Rspec course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four#assignment-1).

## Description

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
